# BrainyPhonics
An application dedicated towards providing lectures and quizzes to underprivileged elementary school students in a fun and interactive way.

# Motivation
The purpose of this project is to provide an app version of the already existing BrainyPhonics web application. This app runs on Androids and serves to mimic the web application precisely, offering no advantage over the web application or vice versa.

# System Architecture
This project uses a model-view-controller architecture - the models are used to represent entities including the User, Question, Answer, etc. The views are used to provide a kid-friendly interface. The controllers are used to grab data from the Data Analytics Platform, an offline database used to grab assets and information pertaining to classes and quizzes.

# Installation
In order to run this project, JetBrains Toolbox, Gradle, and Android Studio must be installed. Once all of these are installed, clone this repository and open it on Android Studio. Press run in order to have the emulator run the app.

# Credits
Credits to our client - Dr. Walter Evans - who came up with the idea for this project and originally led the team building the web version of the app.
